## Welcome

Welcome to my website! My name is John Rey Cabata√±a and I am an Electronics Engineer with 4 years of experience in the field of electronics and robotics. I have a passion for building, tinkering, and making new things using a variety of programming languages.

I specialize in designing and innovating new robotics projects and models for the classroom, continuously improving and optimizing codes for different robots, and teaching and coaching students for robotics competitions. I also have experience in participating and conducting robotics displays for various events and schools, as well as checking, experimenting, and testing different electronics equipment such as microcontrollers, shields, and modules.

In terms of technical skills, I am proficient in hardware troubleshooting, network troubleshooting, electronic and robotics design, programming in robotics (C++, Python, Scratch, Flowchart), mobile app making (Kodular), electronics software (Arduino, EasyEDA), 3D editing (TinkerCAD, AutoCAD, Blender), and graphic editing (MSOffice, Photoshop, Correl, Openshot).

I have a Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering from Iloilo Science and Technology University.

My interests include building electronics projects and DIY stuff, hacking, artificial intelligence, 3D printing, and retropi using Raspberry Pi.
