# SpongeBot 
Spongebob robot i made for jade. 


SpongeBob SquarePants has been a beloved character for over two decades, entertaining audiences of all ages with his wacky antics and hilarious adventures. With the rise of technology, it's now possible to bring SpongeBob to life in a new and exciting way. In this blog post, we'll be exploring a project that does just that – the SpongeBot!

# Introduction to the Project

The SpongeBot is a robot inspired by the character SpongeBob SquarePants. It's made using a combination of an Arduino microcontroller, motors, a motor driver, Bluetooth connectivity, and a mobile app. The Arduino acts as the brains of the robot, while the motors allow it to move and the Bluetooth connectivity allows it to be controlled remotely via a mobile app.

here's some layout of how you can build the structure of spongebot

# Setting Up the Arduino

The first step in creating the SpongeBot is acquiring all of the necessary parts. This includes an Arduino board, motors, a motor driver, and a Bluetooth module. Once you have all of the components, the next step is to assemble the circuit. This involves connecting the various components to the Arduino board, including the motors and the Bluetooth module. Finally, you'll need to connect the Arduino board to your computer, allowing you to program it and test it.

Once the circuit is assembled, you can connect the Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable. You will then install the necessary software, such as the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and any necessary drivers. https://arduino.cc

# Programming the Arduino

The next step in creating the SpongeBot is to program the Arduino. This involves installing the necessary software, coding the Arduino, and implementing Bluetooth connectivity. The coding aspect of the project is the most challenging, as it requires a good understanding of programming and electronics. However, with the help of online tutorials and forums, it's possible to complete this step with relative ease.

here's the program:

Once the code is written, you can debug and test it using the Arduino IDE. This will help you identify and fix any bugs in the code, and ensure that the robot is functioning correctly.

# Designing the Mobile App

The mobile app is an essential component of the SpongeBot project, as it allows you to control the robot remotely. There are many development platforms available, including Android Studio and Kodular which i used, which can be used to create the app. You'll need to design the user interface, including buttons for controlling the robot's movement, and add Bluetooth functionality, allowing the app to communicate with the Arduino.

# Testing & Debugging

Once the circuit is assembled and the code is written, it's time to test and debug the SpongeBot. This involves verifying the circuit connections, debugging the code, and testing the Bluetooth connection. It's important to take your time and thoroughly test the robot to ensure that it's functioning properly.

# Connecting the Mobile App

The Bluetooth module allows the SpongeBot to communicate with a mobile app over a wireless connection. The mobile app provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to control the robot.

1. Switch ON the spongebot

# Final Thoughts & Future Improvements

The SpongeBot is a fun and challenging project that provides a great introduction to the world of robotics and electronics. While it may be a simple project, it has the potential to be improved and upgraded in the future. For example, you could add additional sensors, such as a distance sensor, camera for facial recognition to make the robot more advanced. Additionally, you could add additional functionality like incorporating Artificial Intelligence on it and with all the machine learning technologies now.
